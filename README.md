# Jazz Chord Progressions
This project requires the user to input the desired Key they wish to start as well as either the Major or Minor Scale. From there the program will give you the chords to commonly used Jazz Progressions

The Purpose of this program is for muscicians to practice their common chord progressions in different keys without having to remember the chords themselves. This allows the muscican to focus on the changes themselves and the relationship the Chords have to each other streamlining the practice process.
